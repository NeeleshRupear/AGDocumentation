Self-Reflective Report on Algorithms and Complexity
Introduction
The study of algorithms and complexity is fundamental to computer science, since it supports the efficiency and effectiveness of computational solutions. This report digs into my own experience with the Algorithms and Complexity module, examining the fundamental principles that have impacted my knowledge of problem solving and computational thinking. Throughout the course, I worked with key concepts like as recursion, data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs), sorting and searching algorithms, and hashing. This investigation went beyond theoretical comprehension, as I applied these principles to real-world circumstances, experiencing and overcoming hurdles that improved my respect for the complexities of algorithm design and execution. This report reflects on my learning experiences, the applications I investigated, the challenges I encountered, and the discoveries. I gained, emphasising the module's transformational influence on my approach to problem solving and overall view on computer science.




1. Algorithm Design and Problem-Solving
a. Recursion
* Understanding: Recursion is a strong problem-solving technique in which a function calls itself. I came to appreciate its capacity to decompose big issues into simpler subproblems.

* Application: I used recursion to tackle problems like factorial computation, Fibonacci series, and tree traversal. Identifying base cases and regulating recursion depth were critical skills that I acquired.

* Challenges: Initially, I struggled with stack overflows and infinite recursion. Despite these hurdles, I gained a better knowledge of recursion's constraints and its interaction with system resources by paying close attention to base cases and, where required, considering iterative alternatives. This experience demonstrated the value of strategic planning and resource management in algorithm development.

* Impact on Learning :  Dealing with these obstacles changed my attitude to problem solving. I grew better at identifying possible issues and proactively incorporating protections into my code. In addition, I learnt how to objectively analyse the viability of recursion for various cases, taking into account aspects such as issue size and available memory.

   * Influence on Thinking : The principles I learnt through recursion have affected my thinking in various aspects of computer science. For example, the divide-and-conquer method used in recursion has similarities to algorithm design paradigms such as dynamic programming. Understanding the fundamental concepts of recursion has improved my ability to recognise and use comparable patterns in a variety of settings, resulting in a more holistic and adaptive approach to problem solving.
















b. Dynamic Problem-Solving with Linked Lists
   * Understanding: Linked lists are dynamic data structures that enable efficient insertion and deletion. Operations like as insertion, deletion, and traversal need mastery of node manipulation techniques.

      * Application: Using linked lists improved my problem-solving abilities, particularly in circumstances that required dynamic memory allocation. Projects such as developing a simple memory management system benefitted from linked list operations.

      * Challenges: Handling edge situations like empty lists and single-node lists was difficult. To guarantee solid implementations, I conducted comprehensive testing and debugging.
2. Core Data Structures
        i) Stacks and Queues
        
         * Understanding: Stacks (LIFO) and Queues (FIFO) are fundamental data structures with diverse applications. Implementing these structures strengthened my grasp of their practical uses.

         * Application: 

I applied stacks in various scenarios, such as:

            * Expression evaluation: I used a stack to evaluate arithmetic expressions, pushing operands onto the stack and popping them when encountering operators to perform calculations.

            * Function call stack: I gained insights into how stacks are used internally by programming languages to manage function calls and their local variables.

            * Undo/redo functionality: I implemented undo/redo features in applications using a stack to store previous states or actions.

I also applied queues in various scenarios, such as:
               * Breadth-first search (BFS): I employed a queue to implement BFS traversal in graph algorithms, ensuring that nodes are visited in the correct order.

               * Resource management: I utilized queues to manage tasks or requests in a first-come, first-served manner, ensuring fair and efficient processing.

               * Simulation: I used queues to model real-world scenarios like customer service lines or waiting lists, simulating the order of service or processing.

                  * Challenges: Ensuring efficient and correct implementation of stack and queue operations presented some difficulties. For instance, I encountered issues with handling edge cases like empty structures or managing memory allocation dynamically.

                  * Overcoming Challenges: To address these challenges, I employed several strategies:



                     * Visualization: I used visual aids like diagrams and drawings to better understand the behavior of stacks and queues, helping me to identify and correct errors in my implementation.

                     * Step-by-step debugging: I used a debugger to step through my code line by line, examining the state of the stack or queue at each step and identifying where errors occurred.

                     * Unit testing: I wrote unit tests to verify the correctness of individual stack and queue operations, ensuring that they behaved as expected in various scenarios.

                     * Code review: I sought feedback from peers or instructors to identify potential issues and improve the clarity and efficiency of my code.


ii) Tree Structures and Their Applications
                        * Understanding: Binary trees and binary search trees (BSTs) are hierarchical data structures that enable efficient searching, insertion, and deletion. I grasped the importance of traversal strategies like in-order, pre-order, and post-order for different use cases.
                        * Applications: 

I utilized tree structures in various scenarios, including:
                           * Hierarchical Data Representation: I used trees to represent hierarchical relationships in data, such as file systems, organizational charts, or family trees. This allowed for intuitive and efficient navigation and manipulation of the data.

                           * Efficient Searching and Sorting: I implemented BSTs to store and retrieve data quickly, especially when dealing with large datasets. The logarithmic time complexity of search operations in BSTs offered significant performance advantages over linear search algorithms.

                           * Decision Trees: I employed decision trees in machine learning algorithms to classify data based on a series of features. The hierarchical structure of decision trees enabled efficient and interpretable decision-making processes.

                           * Expression Parsing: I used trees to represent and evaluate mathematical expressions, where the internal nodes represented operators and the leaves represented operands. This facilitated the parsing and evaluation of complex expressions.

                              * Specific Problems Solved:

                                 * Database Indexing: I used BSTs to index data in databases, enabling faster search and retrieval of records based on specific criteria.
